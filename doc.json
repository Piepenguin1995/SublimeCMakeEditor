    "find_package": "find_package\n------------\n\nLoad settings for an external project.\n\n::\n\n  find_package(<package> [version] [EXACT] [QUIET] [MODULE]\n               [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]\n               [OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS components...]\n               [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])\n\nFinds and loads settings from an external project.  ``<package>_FOUND``\nwill be set to indicate whether the package was found.  When the\npackage is found package-specific information is provided through\nvariables and :ref:`Imported Targets` documented by the package itself.  The\n``QUIET`` option disables messages if the package cannot be found.  The\n``MODULE`` option disables the second signature documented below.  The\n``REQUIRED`` option stops processing with an error message if the package\ncannot be found.\n\nA package-specific list of required components may be listed after the\n``COMPONENTS`` option (or after the ``REQUIRED`` option if present).\nAdditional optional components may be listed after\n``OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS``.  Available components and their influence on\nwhether a package is considered to be found are defined by the target\npackage.\n\nThe ``[version]`` argument requests a version with which the package found\nshould be compatible (format is ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``).  The\n``EXACT`` option requests that the version be matched exactly.  If no\n``[version]`` and/or component list is given to a recursive invocation\ninside a find-module, the corresponding arguments are forwarded\nautomatically from the outer call (including the ``EXACT`` flag for\n``[version]``).  Version support is currently provided only on a\npackage-by-package basis (details below).\n\nUser code should generally look for packages using the above simple\nsignature.  The remainder of this command documentation specifies the\nfull command signature and details of the search process.  Project\nmaintainers wishing to provide a package to be found by this command\nare encouraged to read on.\n\nThe command has two modes by which it searches for packages: \"Module\"\nmode and \"Config\" mode.  Module mode is available when the command is\ninvoked with the above reduced signature.  CMake searches for a file\ncalled ``Find<package>.cmake`` in the :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`\nfollowed by the CMake installation.  If the file is found, it is read\nand processed by CMake.  It is responsible for finding the package,\nchecking the version, and producing any needed messages.  Many\nfind-modules provide limited or no support for versioning; check\nthe module documentation.  If no module is found and the ``MODULE``\noption is not given the command proceeds to Config mode.\n\nThe complete Config mode command signature is::\n\n  find_package(<package> [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]\n               [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]\n               [CONFIG|NO_MODULE]\n               [NO_POLICY_SCOPE]\n               [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]]\n               [CONFIGS config1 [config2 ...]]\n               [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ]]\n               [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ]]\n               [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]\n               [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]\n               [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]\n               [NO_CMAKE_PATH]\n               [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]\n               [NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]\n               [NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH]\n               [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]\n               [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]\n               [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |\n                ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |\n                NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])\n\nThe ``CONFIG`` option may be used to skip Module mode explicitly and\nswitch to Config mode.  It is synonymous to using ``NO_MODULE``.  Config\nmode is also implied by use of options not specified in the reduced\nsignature.\n\nConfig mode attempts to locate a configuration file provided by the\npackage to be found.  A cache entry called ``<package>_DIR`` is created to\nhold the directory containing the file.  By default the command\nsearches for a package with the name ``<package>``.  If the ``NAMES`` option\nis given the names following it are used instead of ``<package>``.  The\ncommand searches for a file called ``<name>Config.cmake`` or\n``<lower-case-name>-config.cmake`` for each name specified.  A\nreplacement set of possible configuration file names may be given\nusing the ``CONFIGS`` option.  The search procedure is specified below.\nOnce found, the configuration file is read and processed by CMake.\nSince the file is provided by the package it already knows the\nlocation of package contents.  The full path to the configuration file\nis stored in the cmake variable ``<package>_CONFIG``.\n\nAll configuration files which have been considered by CMake while\nsearching for an installation of the package with an appropriate\nversion are stored in the cmake variable ``<package>_CONSIDERED_CONFIGS``,\nthe associated versions in ``<package>_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS``.\n\nIf the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will generate\nan error describing the problem unless the ``QUIET`` argument is\nspecified.  If ``REQUIRED`` is specified and the package is not found a\nfatal error is generated and the configure step stops executing.  If\n``<package>_DIR`` has been set to a directory not containing a\nconfiguration file CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.\n\nWhen the ``[version]`` argument is given Config mode will only find a\nversion of the package that claims compatibility with the requested\nversion (format is ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``).  If the ``EXACT``\noption is given only a version of the package claiming an exact match\nof the requested version may be found.  CMake does not establish any\nconvention for the meaning of version numbers.  Package version\nnumbers are checked by \"version\" files provided by the packages\nthemselves.  For a candidate package configuration file\n``<config-file>.cmake`` the corresponding version file is located next\nto it and named either ``<config-file>-version.cmake`` or\n``<config-file>Version.cmake``.  If no such version file is available\nthen the configuration file is assumed to not be compatible with any\nrequested version.  A basic version file containing generic version\nmatching code can be created using the\n:module:`CMakePackageConfigHelpers` module.  When a version file\nis found it is loaded to check the requested version number.  The\nversion file is loaded in a nested scope in which the following\nvariables have been defined:\n\n``PACKAGE_FIND_NAME``\n  the ``<package>`` name\n``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION``\n  full requested version string\n``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR``\n  major version if requested, else 0\n``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR``\n  minor version if requested, else 0\n``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH``\n  patch version if requested, else 0\n``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK``\n  tweak version if requested, else 0\n``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT``\n  number of version components, 0 to 4\n\nThe version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version and\nsets these variables:\n\n``PACKAGE_VERSION``\n  full provided version string\n``PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT``\n  true if version is exact match\n``PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE``\n  true if version is compatible\n``PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE``\n  true if unsuitable as any version\n\nThese variables are checked by the ``find_package`` command to determine\nwhether the configuration file provides an acceptable version.  They\nare not available after the find_package call returns.  If the version\nis acceptable the following variables are set:\n\n``<package>_VERSION``\n  full provided version string\n``<package>_VERSION_MAJOR``\n  major version if provided, else 0\n``<package>_VERSION_MINOR``\n  minor version if provided, else 0\n``<package>_VERSION_PATCH``\n  patch version if provided, else 0\n``<package>_VERSION_TWEAK``\n  tweak version if provided, else 0\n``<package>_VERSION_COUNT``\n  number of version components, 0 to 4\n\nand the corresponding package configuration file is loaded.  When\nmultiple package configuration files are available whose version files\nclaim compatibility with the version requested it is unspecified which\none is chosen.  No attempt is made to choose a highest or closest\nversion number.\n\nConfig mode provides an elaborate interface and search procedure.\nMuch of the interface is provided for completeness and for use\ninternally by find-modules loaded by Module mode.  Most user code\nshould simply call::\n\n  find_package(<package> [major[.minor]] [EXACT] [REQUIRED|QUIET])\n\nin order to find a package.  Package maintainers providing CMake\npackage configuration files are encouraged to name and install them\nsuch that the procedure outlined below will find them without\nrequiring use of additional options.\n\nCMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes for the\npackage.  Under each prefix several directories are searched for a\nconfiguration file.  The tables below show the directories searched.\nEach entry is meant for installation trees following Windows (W), UNIX\n(U), or Apple (A) conventions::\n\n  <prefix>/                                               (W)\n  <prefix>/(cmake|CMake)/                                 (W)\n  <prefix>/<name>*/                                       (W)\n  <prefix>/<name>*/(cmake|CMake)/                         (W)\n  <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib|share)/cmake/<name>*/          (U)\n  <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib|share)/<name>*/                (U)\n  <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib|share)/<name>*/(cmake|CMake)/  (U)\n\nOn systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application Bundles the\nfollowing directories are searched for frameworks or bundles\ncontaining a configuration file::\n\n  <prefix>/<name>.framework/Resources/                    (A)\n  <prefix>/<name>.framework/Resources/CMake/              (A)\n  <prefix>/<name>.framework/Versions/*/Resources/         (A)\n  <prefix>/<name>.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/   (A)\n  <prefix>/<name>.app/Contents/Resources/                 (A)\n  <prefix>/<name>.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/           (A)\n\nIn all cases the ``<name>`` is treated as case-insensitive and corresponds\nto any of the names specified (``<package>`` or names given by ``NAMES``).\nPaths with ``lib/<arch>`` are enabled if the\n:variable:`CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE` variable is set.  If ``PATH_SUFFIXES``\nis specified the suffixes are appended to each (W) or (U) directory entry\none-by-one.\n\nThis set of directories is intended to work in cooperation with\nprojects that provide configuration files in their installation trees.\nDirectories above marked with (W) are intended for installations on\nWindows where the prefix may point at the top of an application's\ninstallation directory.  Those marked with (U) are intended for\ninstallations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared by multiple\npackages.  This is merely a convention, so all (W) and (U) directories\nare still searched on all platforms.  Directories marked with (A) are\nintended for installations on Apple platforms.  The cmake variables\n``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` and ``CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE``\ndetermine the order of preference as specified below.\n\nThe set of installation prefixes is constructed using the following\nsteps.  If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is specified all ``NO_*`` options are\nenabled.\n\n1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.  These\n   are intended to be used on the command line with a ``-DVAR=value``.\n   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_PATH`` is passed::\n\n     CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\n     CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH\n     CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH\n\n2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.\n   These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration.\n   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed::\n\n     <package>_DIR\n     CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\n     CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH\n     CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH\n\n3. Search paths specified by the ``HINTS`` option.  These should be paths\n   computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the\n   location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses should\n   be specified with the ``PATHS`` option.\n\n4. Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be\n   skipped if ``NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed.  Path entries\n   ending in ``/bin`` or ``/sbin`` are automatically converted to their\n   parent directories::\n\n     PATH\n\n5. Search project build trees recently configured in a :manual:`cmake-gui(1)`.\n   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH`` is passed.  It is intended\n   for the case when a user is building multiple dependent projects one\n   after another.\n   (This step is implemented only on Windows.)\n\n6. Search paths stored in the CMake :ref:`User Package Registry`.\n   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` is passed.\n   See the :manual:`cmake-packages(7)` manual for details on the user\n   package registry.\n\n7. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the\n   current system.  This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH`` is\n   passed::\n\n     CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH\n     CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH\n     CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH\n\n8. Search paths stored in the CMake :ref:`System Package Registry`.\n   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` is passed.\n   See the :manual:`cmake-packages(7)` manual for details on the system\n   package registry.\n\n9. Search paths specified by the ``PATHS`` option.  These are typically\n   hard-coded guesses.\n\n.. |FIND_XXX| replace:: find_package\n.. |FIND_ARGS_XXX| replace:: <package>\n.. |CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_XXX| replace::\n   :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE`\n\n.. include:: FIND_XXX_MAC.txt\n.. include:: FIND_XXX_ROOT.txt\n.. include:: FIND_XXX_ORDER.txt\n\nEvery non-REQUIRED ``find_package`` call can be disabled by setting the\n:variable:`CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>` variable to ``TRUE``.\n\nWhen loading a find module or package configuration file ``find_package``\ndefines variables to provide information about the call arguments (and\nrestores their original state before returning):\n\n``<package>_FIND_REQUIRED``\n  true if ``REQUIRED`` option was given\n``<package>_FIND_QUIETLY``\n  true if ``QUIET`` option was given\n``<package>_FIND_VERSION``\n  full requested version string\n``<package>_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR``\n  major version if requested, else 0\n``<package>_FIND_VERSION_MINOR``\n  minor version if requested, else 0\n``<package>_FIND_VERSION_PATCH``\n  patch version if requested, else 0\n``<package>_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK``\n  tweak version if requested, else 0\n``<package>_FIND_VERSION_COUNT``\n  number of version components, 0 to 4\n``<package>_FIND_VERSION_EXACT``\n  true if ``EXACT`` option was given\n``<package>_FIND_COMPONENTS``\n  list of requested components\n``<package>_FIND_REQUIRED_<c>``\n  true if component ``<c>`` is required,\n  false if component ``<c>`` is optional\n\nIn Module mode the loaded find module is responsible to honor the\nrequest detailed by these variables; see the find module for details.\nIn Config mode ``find_package`` handles ``REQUIRED``, ``QUIET``, and\n``[version]`` options automatically but leaves it to the package\nconfiguration file to handle components in a way that makes sense\nfor the package.  The package configuration file may set\n``<package>_FOUND`` to false to tell ``find_package`` that component\nrequirements are not satisfied.\n\nSee the :command:`cmake_policy` command documentation for discussion\nof the ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` option.\n", 
    "try_compile": "try_compile\n-----------\n\nTry building some code.\n\n::\n\n  try_compile(RESULT_VAR <bindir> <srcdir>\n              <projectName> [targetName] [CMAKE_FLAGS flags...]\n              [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>])\n\nTry building a project.  In this form, srcdir should contain a\ncomplete CMake project with a CMakeLists.txt file and all sources.\nThe bindir and srcdir will not be deleted after this command is run.\nSpecify targetName to build a specific target instead of the 'all' or\n'ALL_BUILD' target.\n\n::\n\n  try_compile(RESULT_VAR <bindir> <srcfile|SOURCES srcfile...>\n              [CMAKE_FLAGS flags...]\n              [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS flags...]\n              [LINK_LIBRARIES libs...]\n              [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>]\n              [COPY_FILE <fileName> [COPY_FILE_ERROR <var>]])\n\nTry building an executable from one or more source files.  In this\nform the user need only supply one or more source files that include a\ndefinition for 'main'.  CMake will create a CMakeLists.txt file to\nbuild the source(s) as an executable.  Specify COPY_FILE to get a copy\nof the linked executable at the given fileName and optionally\nCOPY_FILE_ERROR to capture any error.\n\nIn this version all files in bindir/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp will be\ncleaned automatically.  For debugging, --debug-trycompile can be\npassed to cmake to avoid this clean.  However, multiple sequential\ntry_compile operations reuse this single output directory.  If you use\n--debug-trycompile, you can only debug one try_compile call at a time.\nThe recommended procedure is to configure with cmake all the way\nthrough once, then delete the cache entry associated with the\ntry_compile call of interest, and then re-run cmake again with\n--debug-trycompile.\n\nSome extra flags that can be included are, INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES,\nLINK_DIRECTORIES, and LINK_LIBRARIES.  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS are\n-Ddefinition that will be passed to the compile line.\n\nThe srcfile signature also accepts a LINK_LIBRARIES argument which may\ncontain a list of libraries or IMPORTED targets which will be linked\nto in the generated project.  If LINK_LIBRARIES is specified as a\nparameter to try_compile, then any LINK_LIBRARIES passed as\nCMAKE_FLAGS will be ignored.\n\ntry_compile creates a CMakeList.txt file on the fly that looks like\nthis:\n\n::\n\n  add_definitions( <expanded COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from calling cmake>)\n  include_directories(${INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES})\n  link_directories(${LINK_DIRECTORIES})\n  add_executable(cmTryCompileExec sources)\n  target_link_libraries(cmTryCompileExec ${LINK_LIBRARIES})\n\nIn both versions of the command, if OUTPUT_VARIABLE is specified, then\nthe output from the build process is stored in the given variable.\nThe success or failure of the try_compile, i.e.  TRUE or FALSE\nrespectively, is returned in RESULT_VAR.  CMAKE_FLAGS can be used to\npass -DVAR:TYPE=VALUE flags to the cmake that is run during the build.\nSet variable CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION to choose a build\nconfiguration.\n",

    "cmake_policy": "cmake_policy\n------------\n\nManage CMake Policy settings.\n\nAs CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change existing behavior\nin order to fix bugs or improve implementations of existing features.\nThe CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects\nbuilding as new versions of CMake introduce changes in behavior.  Each\nnew policy (behavioral change) is given an identifier of the form\n\"CMP<NNNN>\" where \"<NNNN>\" is an integer index.  Documentation\nassociated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW behavior and the\nreason the policy was introduced.  Projects may set each policy to\nselect the desired behavior.  When CMake needs to know which behavior\nto use it checks for a setting specified by the project.  If no\nsetting is available the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is\nproduced requesting that the policy be set.\n\nThe cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD or NEW\nbehavior.  While setting policies individually is supported, we\nencourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions.\n\n::\n\n  cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch[.tweak]])\n\nSpecify that the current CMake list file is written for the given\nversion of CMake.  All policies introduced in the specified version or\nearlier will be set to use NEW behavior.  All policies introduced\nafter the specified version will be unset (unless variable\nCMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN> sets a default).  This effectively\nrequests behavior preferred as of a given CMake version and tells\nnewer CMake versions to warn about their new policies.  The policy\nversion specified must be at least 2.4 or the command will report an\nerror.  In order to get compatibility features supporting versions\nearlier than 2.4 see documentation of policy CMP0001.\n\n::\n\n  cmake_policy(SET CMP<NNNN> NEW)\n  cmake_policy(SET CMP<NNNN> OLD)\n\nTell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given policy.\nProjects depending on the old behavior of a given policy may silence a\npolicy warning by setting the policy state to OLD.  Alternatively one\nmay fix the project to work with the new behavior and set the policy\nstate to NEW.\n\n::\n\n  cmake_policy(GET CMP<NNNN> <variable>)\n\nCheck whether a given policy is set to OLD or NEW behavior.  The\noutput variable value will be \"OLD\" or \"NEW\" if the policy is set, and\nempty otherwise.\n\nCMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made by the\ncmake_policy command affect only the top of the stack.  A new entry on\nthe policy stack is managed automatically for each subdirectory to\nprotect its parents and siblings.  CMake also manages a new entry for\nscripts loaded by include() and find_package() commands except when\ninvoked with the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option (see also policy CMP0011).\nThe cmake_policy command provides an interface to manage custom\nentries on the policy stack:\n\n::\n\n  cmake_policy(PUSH)\n  cmake_policy(POP)\n\nEach PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.  This is\nuseful to make temporary changes to policy settings.\n\nFunctions and macros record policy settings when they are created and\nuse the pre-record policies when they are invoked.  If the function or\nmacro implementation sets policies, the changes automatically\npropagate up through callers until they reach the closest nested\npolicy stack entry.\n",

Higher granularity may be achieved for\nper-configuration rules by creating and linking to\n:ref:`IMPORTED library targets <Imported Targets>`.\n\nLibrary dependencies are transitive by default with this signature.\nWhen this target is linked into another target then the libraries\nlinked to this target will appear on the link line for the other\ntarget too.

Libraries and targets following\n``LINK_PRIVATE`` are linked to, but are not made part of the\n:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` (or :prop_tgt:`LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`).\n\nThe library dependency graph is normally acyclic (a DAG), but in the case\nof mutually-dependent ``STATIC`` libraries CMake allows the graph to\ncontain cycles (strongly connected components).  When another target links\nto one of the libraries, CMake repeats the entire connected component.\nFor example, the code\n\n.. code-block:: cmake\n\n  add_library(A STATIC a.c)\n  add_library(B STATIC b.c)\n  target_link_libraries(A B)\n  target_link_libraries(B A)\n  add_executable(main main.c)\n  target_link_libraries(main A)\n\nlinks ``main`` to ``A B A B``.  While one repetition is usually\nsufficient, pathological object file and symbol arrangements can require\nmore.  One may handle such cases by manually repeating the component in\nthe last ``target_link_libraries`` call.  However, if two archives are\nreally so interdependent they should probably be combined into a single\narchive.\n\nArguments to target_link_libraries may use \"generator expressions\"\nwith the syntax ``$<...>``.  Note however, that generator expressions\nwill not be used in OLD handling of :policy:`CMP0003` or :policy:`CMP0004`.\nSee the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available\nexpressions.

Normally, set will set a\nregular CMake variable.  If CACHE is present, then the <variable> is\nput in the cache instead, unless it is already in the cache.  See\nsection 'Variable types in CMake' below for details of regular and\ncache variables and their interactions.  If CACHE is used, <type> and\n<docstring> are required.  <type> is used by the CMake GUI to choose a\nwidget with which the user sets a value.  The value for <type> may be\none of\n\n::\n\n  FILEPATH = File chooser dialog.\n  PATH     = Directory chooser dialog.\n  STRING   = Arbitrary string.\n  BOOL     = Boolean ON/OFF checkbox.\n  INTERNAL = No GUI entry (used for persistent variables).\n\nIf <type> is INTERNAL, the cache variable is marked as internal, and\nwill not be shown to the user in tools like cmake-gui.  This is\nintended for values that should be persisted in the cache, but which\nusers should not normally change.  INTERNAL implies FORCE.\n\nNormally, set(...CACHE...) creates cache variables, but does not\nmodify them.  If FORCE is specified, the value of the cache variable\nis set, even if the variable is already in the cache.  This should\nnormally be avoided, as it will remove any changes to the cache\nvariable's value by the user.\n\nIf PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in the scope\nabove the current scope.  Each new directory or function creates a new\nscope.  This command will set the value of a variable into the parent\ndirectory or calling function (whichever is applicable to the case at\nhand).  PARENT_SCOPE cannot be combined with CACHE.\n\nIf <value> is not specified then the variable is removed instead of\nset.  See also: the unset() command.\n\n::\n\n  set(<variable> <value1> ... <valueN>)\n\nIn this case <variable> is set to a semicolon separated list of\nvalues.\n\n<variable> can be an environment variable such as:\n\n::\n\n  set( ENV{PATH} /home/martink )\n\nin which case the environment variable will be set.\n\n*** Variable types in CMake ***\n\nIn CMake there are two types of variables: normal variables and cache\nvariables.  Normal variables are meant for the internal use of the\nscript (just like variables in most programming languages); they are\nnot persisted across CMake runs.  Cache variables (unless set with\nINTERNAL) are mostly intended for configuration settings where the\nfirst CMake run determines a suitable default value, which the user\ncan then override, by editing the cache with tools such as ccmake or\ncmake-gui.  Cache variables are stored in the CMake cache file, and\nare persisted across CMake runs.\n\nBoth types can exist at the same time with the same name but different\nvalues.  When ${FOO} is evaluated, CMake first looks for a normal\nvariable 'FOO' in scope and uses it if set.  If and only if no normal\nvariable exists then it falls back to the cache variable 'FOO'.\n\nSome examples:\n\nThe code 'set(FOO \"x\")' sets the normal variable 'FOO'.  It does not\ntouch the cache, but it will hide any existing cache value 'FOO'.\n\nThe code 'set(FOO \"x\" CACHE ...)' checks for 'FOO' in the cache,\nignoring any normal variable of the same name.  If 'FOO' is in the\ncache then nothing happens to either the normal variable or the cache\nvariable.  If 'FOO' is not in the cache, then it is added to the\ncache.\n\nFinally, whenever a cache variable is added or modified by a command,\nCMake also *removes* the normal variable of the same name from the\ncurrent scope so that an immediately following evaluation of it will\nexpose the newly cached value.\n\nNormally projects should avoid using normal and cache variables of the\nsame name, as this interaction can be hard to follow.  However, in\nsome situations it can be useful.  One example (used by some\nprojects):\n\nA project has a subproject in its source tree.  The child project has\nits own CMakeLists.txt, which is included from the parent\nCMakeLists.txt using add_subdirectory().  Now, if the parent and the\nchild project provide the same option (for example a compiler option),\nthe parent gets the first chance to add a user-editable option to the\ncache.  Normally, the child would then use the same value that the\nparent uses.  However, it may be necessary to hard-code the value for\nthe child project's option while still allowing the user to edit the\nvalue used by the parent project.  The parent project can achieve this\nsimply by setting a normal variable with the same name as the option\nin a scope sufficient to hide the option's cache variable from the\nchild completely.  The parent has already set the cache variable, so\nthe child's set(...CACHE...) will do nothing, and evaluating the\noption variable will use the value from the normal variable, which\nhides the cache variable.\n",

Similar to the SET command,\nthe LIST command creates new variable values in the current scope,\neven if the list itself is actually defined in a parent scope.  To\npropagate the results of these operations upwards, use SET with\nPARENT_SCOPE, SET with CACHE INTERNAL, or some other means of value\npropagation.\n\nNOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of strings.  To create a\nlist the set command can be used.  For example, set(var a b c d e)\ncreates a list with a;b;c;d;e, and set(var \"a b c d e\") creates a\nstring or a list with one item in it.   (Note macro arguments are not\nvariables, and therefore cannot be used in LIST commands.)\n\nWhen specifying index values, if <element index> is 0 or greater, it\nis indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the\nfirst list element.  If <element index> is -1 or lesser, it is indexed\nfrom the end of the list, with -1 representing the last list element.\nBe careful when counting with negative indices: they do not start from\n0.  -0 is equivalent to 0, the first list element.\n",

The syntax for the command is to list all\nthe files you want to change, and then provide the values you want to\nset next.  You can use any prop value pair you want and extract it\nlater with the GET_TARGET_PROPERTY command.\n\nProperties that affect the name of a target's output file are as\nfollows.  The PREFIX and SUFFIX properties override the default target\nname prefix (such as \"lib\") and suffix (such as \".so\").  IMPORT_PREFIX\nand IMPORT_SUFFIX are the equivalent properties for the import library\ncorresponding to a DLL (for SHARED library targets).  OUTPUT_NAME sets\nthe real name of a target when it is built and can be used to help\ncreate two targets of the same name even though CMake requires unique\nlogical target names.  There is also a <CONFIG>_OUTPUT_NAME that can\nset the output name on a per-configuration basis.  <CONFIG>_POSTFIX\nsets a postfix for the real name of the target when it is built under\nthe configuration named by <CONFIG> (in upper-case, such as\n\"DEBUG_POSTFIX\").  The value of this property is initialized when the\ntarget is created to the value of the variable CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX\n(except for executable targets because earlier CMake versions which\ndid not use this variable for executables).\n\nThe LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link\nstep of a target.  LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG> will add to the configuration\n<CONFIG>, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO.\nDEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when\ncompiling sources in a shared library.  If not set here then it is set\nto target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if the target is\nnot a valid C identifier).  This is useful for headers to know whether\nthey are being included from inside their library or outside to\nproperly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations.  The COMPILE_FLAGS\nproperty sets additional compiler flags used to build sources within\nthe target.  It may also be used to pass additional preprocessor\ndefinitions.\n\nThe LINKER_LANGUAGE property is used to change the tool used to link\nan executable or shared library.  The default is set the language to\nmatch the files in the library.  CXX and C are common values for this\nproperty.\n\nFor shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the\nbuild version and API version respectively.  When building or\ninstalling appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports\nsymlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is\nspecified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.  For\nexecutables VERSION can be used to specify the build version.  When\nbuilding or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the\nplatform supports symlinks.  For shared libraries and executables on\nWindows the VERSION attribute is parsed to extract a \"major.minor\"\nversion number.  These numbers are used as the image version of the\nbinary.\n\nThere are a few properties used to specify RPATH rules.  INSTALL_RPATH\nis a semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed\ntargets (for platforms that support it).  INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH\nis a boolean that if set to true will append directories in the linker\nsearch path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH.\nSKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic\ngeneration of an rpath allowing the target to run from the build tree.\nBUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to link the\ntarget in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.  This takes\nprecedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking\nbefore installation.  INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the\ndirectory portion of the \"install_name\" field of shared libraries on\nMac OSX to use in the installed targets.  When the target is created\nthe values of the variables CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH,\nCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH, CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH,\nCMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH, and CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR are used to\ninitialize these properties.\n\nPROJECT_LABEL can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE\nlike visual studio.  VS_KEYWORD can be set to change the visual studio\nkeyword, for example Qt integration works better if this is set to\nQt4VSv1.0.\n\nVS_SCC_PROJECTNAME, VS_SCC_LOCALPATH, VS_SCC_PROVIDER and\nVS_SCC_AUXPATH can be set to add support for source control bindings\nin a Visual Studio project file.\n\nVS_GLOBAL_<variable> can be set to add a Visual Studio\nproject-specific global variable.  Qt integration works better if\nVS_GLOBAL_QtVersion is set to the Qt version FindQt4.cmake found.  For\nexample, \"4.7.3\"\n\nThe PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old\nway to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a\ntarget.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is\nused to install the target.  Use the INSTALL command instead.\n\nThe EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD property is used by the visual studio\ngenerators.  If it is set to 1 the target will not be part of the\ndefault build when you select \"Build Solution\".  This can also be set\non a per-configuration basis using\nEXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_<CONFIG>.\n", 
    "enable_testing": "enable_testing\n--------------\n\nEnable testing for current directory and below.\n\n::\n\n  enable_testing()\n\nEnables testing for this directory and below.

    "add_custom_command": "add_custom_command\n------------------\n\nAdd a custom build rule to the generated build system.\n\nThere are two main signatures for add_custom_command The first\nsignature is for adding a custom command to produce an output.\n\n::\n\n  add_custom_command(OUTPUT output1 [output2 ...]\n                     COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]\n                     [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]\n                     [MAIN_DEPENDENCY depend]\n                     [DEPENDS [depends...]]\n                     [IMPLICIT_DEPENDS <lang1> depend1\n                                      [<lang2> depend2] ...]\n                     [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]\n                     [COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM] [APPEND])\n\nThis defines a command to generate specified OUTPUT file(s).  A target\ncreated in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file) that specifies any\noutput of the custom command as a source file is given a rule to\ngenerate the file using the command at build time.  Do not list the\noutput in more than one independent target that may build in parallel\nor the two instances of the rule may conflict (instead use\nadd_custom_target to drive the command and make the other targets\ndepend on that one).  If an output name is a relative path it will be\ninterpreted relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the\ncurrent source directory.  Note that MAIN_DEPENDENCY is completely\noptional and is used as a suggestion to visual studio about where to\nhang the custom command.  In makefile terms this creates a new target\nin the following form:\n\n::\n\n  OUTPUT: MAIN_DEPENDENCY DEPENDS\n          COMMAND\n\nIf more than one command is specified they will be executed in order.\nThe optional ARGS argument is for backward compatibility and will be\nignored.\n\nThe second signature adds a custom command to a target such as a\nlibrary or executable.  This is useful for performing an operation\nbefore or after building the target.  The command becomes part of the\ntarget and will only execute when the target itself is built.  If the\ntarget is already built, the command will not execute.\n\n::\n\n  add_custom_command(TARGET target\n                     PRE_BUILD | PRE_LINK | POST_BUILD\n                     COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]\n                     [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]\n                     [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]\n                     [COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM])\n\nThis defines a new command that will be associated with building the\nspecified target.  When the command will happen is determined by which\nof the following is specified:\n\n::\n\n  PRE_BUILD - run before all other dependencies\n  PRE_LINK - run after other dependencies\n  POST_BUILD - run after the target has been built\n\nNote that the PRE_BUILD option is only supported on Visual Studio 7 or\nlater.  For all other generators PRE_BUILD will be treated as\nPRE_LINK.\n\nIf WORKING_DIRECTORY is specified the command will be executed in the\ndirectory given.  If it is a relative path it will be interpreted\nrelative to the build tree directory corresponding to the current\nsource directory.  If COMMENT is set, the value will be displayed as a\nmessage before the commands are executed at build time.  If APPEND is\nspecified the COMMAND and DEPENDS option values are appended to the\ncustom command for the first output specified.  There must have\nalready been a previous call to this command with the same output.\nThe COMMENT, WORKING_DIRECTORY, and MAIN_DEPENDENCY options are\ncurrently ignored when APPEND is given, but may be used in the future.\n\nIf VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands will be\nescaped properly for the build tool so that the invoked command\nreceives each argument unchanged.  Note that one level of escapes is\nstill used by the CMake language processor before add_custom_command\neven sees the arguments.  Use of VERBATIM is recommended as it enables\ncorrect behavior.  When VERBATIM is not given the behavior is platform\nspecific because there is no protection of tool-specific special\ncharacters.\n\nIf the output of the custom command is not actually created as a file\non disk it should be marked as SYMBOLIC with\nSET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES.\n\nThe IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option requests scanning of implicit dependencies\nof an input file.  The language given specifies the programming\nlanguage whose corresponding dependency scanner should be used.\nCurrently only C and CXX language scanners are supported.  The\nlanguage has to be specified for every file in the IMPLICIT_DEPENDS\nlist.  Dependencies discovered from the scanning are added to those of\nthe custom command at build time.  Note that the IMPLICIT_DEPENDS\noption is currently supported only for Makefile generators and will be\nignored by other generators.\n\nIf COMMAND specifies an executable target (created by ADD_EXECUTABLE)\nit will automatically be replaced by the location of the executable\ncreated at build time.  Additionally a target-level dependency will be\nadded so that the executable target will be built before any target\nusing this custom command.  However this does NOT add a file-level\ndependency that would cause the custom command to re-run whenever the\nexecutable is recompiled.\n\nArguments to COMMAND may use \"generator expressions\" with the syntax\n``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for\navailable expressions.\n\nNote that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target this\nexpression is evaluated on.\n\n::\n\n  $<TARGET_POLICY:pol>          = '1' if the policy was NEW when the 'head' target was created, else '0'.  If the policy was not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.  This generator expression only works for a subset of policies.\n  $<INSTALL_PREFIX>         = Content of the install prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and empty otherwise.\n\nBoolean expressions:\n\n::\n\n  $<AND:?[,?]...>           = '1' if all '?' are '1', else '0'\n  $<OR:?[,?]...>            = '0' if all '?' are '0', else '1'\n  $<NOT:?>                  = '0' if '?' is '1', else '1'\n\nwhere '?' is always either '0' or '1'.\n\nExpressions with an implicit 'this' target:\n\n::\n\n  $<TARGET_PROPERTY:prop>   = The value of the property prop on the target on which the generator expression is evaluated.\n\nReferences to target names in generator expressions imply target-level\ndependencies, but NOT file-level dependencies.  List target names with\nthe DEPENDS option to add file dependencies.\n\nThe DEPENDS option specifies files on which the command depends.  If\nany dependency is an OUTPUT of another custom command in the same\ndirectory (CMakeLists.txt file) CMake automatically brings the other\ncustom command into the target in which this command is built.  If\nDEPENDS is not specified the command will run whenever the OUTPUT is\nmissing; if the command does not actually create the OUTPUT then the\nrule will always run.  If DEPENDS specifies any target (created by an\nADD_* command) a target-level dependency is created to make sure the\ntarget is built before any target using this custom command.\nAdditionally, if the target is an executable or library a file-level\ndependency is created to cause the custom command to re-run whenever\nthe target is recompiled.\n", 
    "ctest_update": "ctest_update\n------------\n\nUpdate the work tree from version control.\n\n::\n\n  ctest_update([SOURCE source] [RETURN_VALUE res])\n\nUpdates the given source directory and stores results in Update.xml.\nIf no SOURCE is given, the CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY variable is used.\nThe RETURN_VALUE option specifies a variable in which to store the\nresult, which is the number of files updated or -1 on error.\n",

The\nentire command line must be given in one \"<args>\" argument.\n\nThe UNIX_COMMAND mode separates arguments by unquoted whitespace.  It\nrecognizes both single-quote and double-quote pairs.  A backslash\nescapes the next literal character (\\\" is \"); there are no special\nescapes (\\n is just n).\n\nThe WINDOWS_COMMAND mode parses a windows command-line using the same\nsyntax the runtime library uses to construct argv at startup.

This command is\nintended to be used by projects that use explicit template\ninstantiation.  Template instantiation files can be stored in a\n\"Templates\" subdirectory and collected automatically using this\ncommand to avoid manually listing all instantiations.\n\nIt is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the list of source\nfiles for a library or executable target.  While this seems to work,\nthere is no way for CMake to generate a build system that knows when a\nnew source file has been added.  Normally the generated build system\nknows when it needs to rerun CMake because the CMakeLists.txt file is\nmodified to add a new source.  When the source is just added to the\ndirectory without modifying this file, one would have to manually\nrerun CMake to generate a build system incorporating the new file.\n",

The ``<name>`` corresponds to the\nlogical target name and must be globally unique within a project.  The\nactual file name of the library built is constructed based on\nconventions of the native platform (such as ``lib<name>.a`` or\n``<name>.lib``).\n\n``STATIC``, ``SHARED``, or ``MODULE`` may be given to specify the type of\nlibrary to be created.  ``STATIC`` libraries are archives of object files\nfor use when linking other targets.  ``SHARED`` libraries are linked\ndynamically and loaded at runtime.  ``MODULE`` libraries are plugins that\nare not linked into other targets but may be loaded dynamically at runtime\nusing dlopen-like functionality.

Details\nabout the imported library are specified by setting properties whose names\nbegin in ``IMPORTED_`` and ``INTERFACE_``.  The most important such\nproperty is :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION` (and its per-configuration\nvariant :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>`) which specifies the\nlocation of the main library file on disk.

An object library compiles\nsource files but does not archive or link their object files into a\nlibrary.  Instead other targets created by :command:`add_library` or\n:command:`add_executable` may reference the objects using an expression of the\nform ``$<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib>`` as a source, where ``objlib`` is the\nobject library name.  For example:\n\n.. code-block:: cmake\n\n  add_library(... $<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib> ...)\n  add_executable(... $<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib> ...)\n\nwill include objlib's object files in a library and an executable\nalong with those compiled from their own sources.  Object libraries\nmay contain only sources (and headers) that compile to object files.\nThey may contain custom commands generating such sources, but not\n``PRE_BUILD``, ``PRE_LINK``, or ``POST_BUILD`` commands.  Object libraries\ncannot be imported, exported, installed, or linked.  Some native build\nsystems may not like targets that have only object files, so consider\nadding at least one real source file to any target that references\n``$<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib>``.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::\n\n  add_library(<name> ALIAS <target>)\n\nCreates an :ref:`Alias Target <Alias Targets>`, such that ``<name>`` can be\nused to refer to ``<target>`` in subsequent commands.

The ``<target>``\nmay not be an :ref:`Imported Target <Imported Targets>` or an ``ALIAS``.\n``ALIAS`` targets can be used as linkable targets and as targets to\nread properties from.  They can also be tested for existance with the\nregular :command:`if(TARGET)` subcommand.  The ``<name>`` may not be used\nto modify properties of ``<target>``, that is, it may not be used as the\noperand of :command:`set_property`, :command:`set_target_properties`,\n:command:`target_link_libraries` etc.  An ``ALIAS`` target may not be\ninstalled or exported.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::\n\n  add_library(<name> INTERFACE [IMPORTED [GLOBAL]])\n\nCreates an :ref:`Interface Library <Interface Libraries>`.

Typically the ``INTERFACE_*`` properties are populated on\nthe interface target using the :command:`set_property`,\n:command:`target_link_libraries(INTERFACE)`,\n:command:`target_include_directories(INTERFACE)`,\n:command:`target_compile_options(INTERFACE)`\nand :command:`target_compile_definitions(INTERFACE)` commands, and then it\nis used as an argument to :command:`target_link_libraries` like any other\ntarget.\n\nAn ``INTERFACE`` :ref:`Imported Target <Imported Targets>` may also be\ncreated with this signature.  An ``IMPORTED`` library target references a\nlibrary defined outside the project.  The target name has scope in the\ndirectory in which it is created and below, but the ``GLOBAL`` option\nextends visibility.

Rules\nspecified by calls to this command within a source directory are\nexecuted in order during installation.  The order across directories\nis not defined.\n\nThere are multiple signatures for this command.  Some of them define\ninstallation options for files and targets.  Options common to\nmultiple signatures are covered here but they are valid only for\nsignatures that specify them.  The common options are:\n\n``DESTINATION``\n  Specify the directory on disk to which a file will be installed.\n  If a full path (with a leading slash or drive letter) is given\n  it is used directly.  If a relative path is given it is interpreted\n  relative to the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable.\n  The prefix can be relocated at install time using the ``DESTDIR``\n  mechanism explained in the :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable\n  documentation.\n\n``PERMISSIONS``\n  Specify permissions for installed files.  Valid permissions are\n  ``OWNER_READ``, ``OWNER_WRITE``, ``OWNER_EXECUTE``, ``GROUP_READ``,\n  ``GROUP_WRITE``, ``GROUP_EXECUTE``, ``WORLD_READ``, ``WORLD_WRITE``,\n  ``WORLD_EXECUTE``, ``SETUID``, and ``SETGID``.  Permissions that do\n  not make sense on certain platforms are ignored on those platforms.\n\n``CONFIGURATIONS``\n  Specify a list of build configurations for which the install rule\n  applies (Debug, Release, etc.).\n\n``COMPONENT``\n  Specify an installation component name with which the install rule\n  is associated, such as \"runtime\" or \"development\".  During\n  component-specific installation only install rules associated with\n  the given component name will be executed.  During a full installation\n  all components are installed.  If ``COMPONENT`` is not provided a\n  default component \"Unspecified\" is created.  The default component\n  name may be controlled with the\n  :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME` variable.\n\n``RENAME``\n  Specify a name for an installed file that may be different from the\n  original file.  Renaming is allowed only when a single file is\n  installed by the command.\n\n``OPTIONAL``\n  Specify that it is not an error if the file to be installed does\n  not exist.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::\n\n  install(TARGETS targets... [EXPORT <export-name>]\n          [[ARCHIVE|LIBRARY|RUNTIME|FRAMEWORK|BUNDLE|\n            PRIVATE_HEADER|PUBLIC_HEADER|RESOURCE]\n           [DESTINATION <dir>]\n           [INCLUDES DESTINATION [<dir> ...]]\n           [PERMISSIONS permissions...]\n           [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]\n           [COMPONENT <component>]\n           [OPTIONAL] [NAMELINK_ONLY|NAMELINK_SKIP]\n          ] [...])\n\nThe ``TARGETS`` form specifies rules for installing targets from a\nproject.  There are five kinds of target files that may be installed:\n``ARCHIVE``, ``LIBRARY``, ``RUNTIME``, ``FRAMEWORK``, and ``BUNDLE``.\nExecutables are treated as ``RUNTIME`` targets, except that those\nmarked with the ``MACOSX_BUNDLE`` property are treated as ``BUNDLE``\ntargets on OS X.  Static libraries are always treated as ``ARCHIVE``\ntargets.  Module libraries are always treated as ``LIBRARY`` targets.\nFor non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as ``LIBRARY``\ntargets, except that those marked with the ``FRAMEWORK`` property are\ntreated as ``FRAMEWORK`` targets on OS X.  For DLL platforms the DLL\npart of a shared library is treated as a ``RUNTIME`` target and the\ncorresponding import library is treated as an ``ARCHIVE`` target.\nAll Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.\nThe ``ARCHIVE``, ``LIBRARY``, ``RUNTIME``, and ``FRAMEWORK`` arguments\nchange the type of target to which the subsequent properties apply.\nIf none is given the installation properties apply to all target\ntypes.  If only one is given then only targets of that type will be\ninstalled (which can be used to install just a DLL or just an import\nlibrary).  The ``INCLUDES DESTINATION`` specifies a list of directories\nwhich will be added to the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`\ntarget property of the ``<targets>`` when exported by the\n:command:`install(EXPORT)` command.  If a relative path is\nspecified, it is treated as relative to the ``$<INSTALL_PREFIX>``.\n\nThe ``PRIVATE_HEADER``, ``PUBLIC_HEADER``, and ``RESOURCE`` arguments\ncause subsequent properties to be applied to installing a ``FRAMEWORK``\nshared library target's associated files on non-Apple platforms.  Rules\ndefined by these arguments are ignored on Apple platforms because the\nassociated files are installed into the appropriate locations inside\nthe framework folder.  See documentation of the\n:prop_tgt:`PRIVATE_HEADER`, :prop_tgt:`PUBLIC_HEADER`, and\n:prop_tgt:`RESOURCE` target properties for details.\n\nEither ``NAMELINK_ONLY`` or ``NAMELINK_SKIP`` may be specified as a\n``LIBRARY`` option.  On some platforms a versioned shared library\nhas a symbolic link such as::\n\n  lib<name>.so -> lib<name>.so.1\n\nwhere ``lib<name>.so.1`` is the soname of the library and ``lib<name>.so``\nis a \"namelink\" allowing linkers to find the library when given\n``-l<name>``.  The ``NAMELINK_ONLY`` option causes installation of only the\nnamelink when a library target is installed.  The ``NAMELINK_SKIP`` option\ncauses installation of library files other than the namelink when a\nlibrary target is installed.  When neither option is given both\nportions are installed.  On platforms where versioned shared libraries\ndo not have namelinks or when a library is not versioned the\n``NAMELINK_SKIP`` option installs the library and the ``NAMELINK_ONLY``\noption installs nothing.  See the :prop_tgt:`VERSION` and\n:prop_tgt:`SOVERSION` target properties for details on creating versioned\nshared libraries.\n\nOne or more groups of properties may be specified in a single call to\nthe ``TARGETS`` form of this command.  A target may be installed more than\nonce to different locations.  Consider hypothetical targets ``myExe``,\n``mySharedLib``, and ``myStaticLib``.  The code:\n\n.. code-block:: cmake\n\n  install(TARGETS myExe mySharedLib myStaticLib\n          RUNTIME DESTINATION bin\n          LIBRARY DESTINATION lib\n          ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib/static)\n  install(TARGETS mySharedLib DESTINATION /some/full/path)\n\nwill install ``myExe`` to ``<prefix>/bin`` and ``myStaticLib`` to\n``<prefix>/lib/static``.  On non-DLL platforms ``mySharedLib`` will be\ninstalled to ``<prefix>/lib`` and ``/some/full/path``.  On DLL platforms\nthe ``mySharedLib`` DLL will be installed to ``<prefix>/bin`` and\n``/some/full/path`` and its import library will be installed to\n``<prefix>/lib/static`` and ``/some/full/path``.\n\nThe ``EXPORT`` option associates the installed target files with an\nexport called ``<export-name>``.  It must appear before any ``RUNTIME``,\n``LIBRARY``, or ``ARCHIVE`` options.  To actually install the export\nfile itself, call ``install(EXPORT)``, documented below.\n\nInstalling a target with the :prop_tgt:`EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` target property\nset to ``TRUE`` has undefined behavior.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::\n\n  install(<FILES|PROGRAMS> files... DESTINATION <dir>\n          [PERMISSIONS permissions...]\n          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]\n          [COMPONENT <component>]\n          [RENAME <name>] [OPTIONAL])\n\nThe ``FILES`` form specifies rules for installing files for a project.\nFile names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the\ncurrent source directory.  Files installed by this form are by default\ngiven permissions ``OWNER_WRITE``, ``OWNER_READ``, ``GROUP_READ``, and\n``WORLD_READ`` if no ``PERMISSIONS`` argument is given.\n\nThe ``PROGRAMS`` form is identical to the ``FILES`` form except that the\ndefault permissions for the installed file also include ``OWNER_EXECUTE``,\n``GROUP_EXECUTE``, and ``WORLD_EXECUTE``.  This form is intended to install\nprograms that are not targets, such as shell scripts.  Use the ``TARGETS``\nform to install targets built within the project.\n\nThe list of ``files...`` given to ``FILES`` or ``PROGRAMS`` may use\n\"generator expressions\" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the\n:manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available expressions.\nHowever, if any item begins in a generator expression it must evaluate\nto a full path.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::\n\n  install(DIRECTORY dirs... DESTINATION <dir>\n          [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]\n          [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]\n          [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [OPTIONAL]\n          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]\n          [COMPONENT <component>] [FILES_MATCHING]\n          [[PATTERN <pattern> | REGEX <regex>]\n           [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])\n\nThe ``DIRECTORY`` form installs contents of one or more directories to a\ngiven destination.  The directory structure is copied verbatim to the\ndestination.  The last component of each directory name is appended to\nthe destination directory but a trailing slash may be used to avoid\nthis because it leaves the last component empty.  Directory names\ngiven as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the current\nsource directory.  If no input directory names are given the\ndestination directory will be created but nothing will be installed\ninto it.  The ``FILE_PERMISSIONS`` and ``DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS`` options\nspecify permissions given to files and directories in the destination.\nIf ``USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS`` is specified and ``FILE_PERMISSIONS`` is not,\nfile permissions will be copied from the source directory structure.\nIf no permissions are specified files will be given the default\npermissions specified in the ``FILES`` form of the command, and the\ndirectories will be given the default permissions specified in the\n``PROGRAMS`` form of the command.\n\nInstallation of directories may be controlled with fine granularity\nusing the ``PATTERN`` or ``REGEX`` options.  These \"match\" options specify a\nglobbing pattern or regular expression to match directories or files\nencountered within input directories.  They may be used to apply\ncertain options (see below) to a subset of the files and directories\nencountered.  The full path to each input file or directory (with\nforward slashes) is matched against the expression.  A ``PATTERN`` will\nmatch only complete file names: the portion of the full path matching\nthe pattern must occur at the end of the file name and be preceded by\na slash.  A ``REGEX`` will match any portion of the full path but it may\nuse ``/`` and ``$`` to simulate the ``PATTERN`` behavior.  By default all\nfiles and directories are installed whether or not they are matched.\nThe ``FILES_MATCHING`` option may be given before the first match option\nto disable installation of files (but not directories) not matched by\nany expression.  For example, the code\n\n.. code-block:: cmake\n\n  install(DIRECTORY src/ DESTINATION include/myproj\n          FILES_MATCHING PATTERN \"*.h\")\n\nwill extract and install header files from a source tree.\n\nSome options may follow a ``PATTERN`` or ``REGEX`` expression and are applied\nonly to files or directories matching them.  The ``EXCLUDE`` option will\nskip the matched file or directory.  The ``PERMISSIONS`` option overrides\nthe permissions setting for the matched file or directory.  For\nexample the code\n\n.. code-block:: cmake\n\n  install(DIRECTORY icons scripts/ DESTINATION share/myproj\n          PATTERN \"CVS\" EXCLUDE\n          PATTERN \"scripts/*\"\n          PERMISSIONS OWNER_EXECUTE OWNER_WRITE OWNER_READ\n                      GROUP_EXECUTE GROUP_READ)\n\nwill install the ``icons`` directory to ``share/myproj/icons`` and the\n``scripts`` directory to ``share/myproj``.  The icons will get default\nfile permissions, the scripts will be given specific permissions, and any\n``CVS`` directories will be excluded.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::\n\n  install([[SCRIPT <file>] [CODE <code>]] [...])\n\nThe ``SCRIPT`` form will invoke the given CMake script files during\ninstallation.  If the script file name is a relative path it will be\ninterpreted with respect to the current source directory.  The ``CODE``\nform will invoke the given CMake code during installation.  Code is\nspecified as a single argument inside a double-quoted string.  For\nexample, the code\n\n.. code-block:: cmake\n\n  install(CODE \"MESSAGE(\\\"Sample install message.\\\")\")\n\nwill print a message during installation.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::\n\n  install(EXPORT <export-name> DESTINATION <dir>\n          [NAMESPACE <namespace>] [FILE <name>.cmake]\n          [PERMISSIONS permissions...]\n          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]\n          [EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES]\n          [COMPONENT <component>])\n\nThe ``EXPORT`` form generates and installs a CMake file containing code to\nimport targets from the installation tree into another project.\nTarget installations are associated with the export ``<export-name>``\nusing the ``EXPORT`` option of the ``install(TARGETS)`` signature\ndocumented above.  The ``NAMESPACE`` option will prepend ``<namespace>`` to\nthe target names as they are written to the import file.  By default\nthe generated file will be called ``<export-name>.cmake`` but the ``FILE``\noption may be used to specify a different name.  The value given to\nthe ``FILE`` option must be a file name with the ``.cmake`` extension.\nIf a ``CONFIGURATIONS`` option is given then the file will only be installed\nwhen one of the named configurations is installed.  Additionally, the\ngenerated import file will reference only the matching target\nconfigurations.  The ``EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`` keyword, if\npresent, causes the contents of the properties matching\n``(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?`` to be exported, when\npolicy :policy:`CMP0022` is ``NEW``.  If a ``COMPONENT`` option is\nspecified that does not match that given to the targets associated with\n``<export-name>`` the behavior is undefined.  If a library target is\nincluded in the export but a target to which it links is not included\nthe behavior is unspecified.\n\nThe ``EXPORT`` form is useful to help outside projects use targets built\nand installed by the current project.  For example, the code\n\n.. code-block:: cmake\n\n  install(TARGETS myexe EXPORT myproj DESTINATION bin)\n  install(EXPORT myproj NAMESPACE mp_ DESTINATION lib/myproj)\n\nwill install the executable myexe to ``<prefix>/bin`` and code to import\nit in the file ``<prefix>/lib/myproj/myproj.cmake``.  An outside project\nmay load this file with the include command and reference the ``myexe``\nexecutable from the installation tree using the imported target name\n``mp_myexe`` as if the target were built in its own tree.\n\n.. note::\n  This command supercedes the :command:`install_targets` command and\n  the :prop_tgt:`PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT` and :prop_tgt:`POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT`\n  target properties.  It also replaces the ``FILES`` forms of the\n  :command:`install_files` and :command:`install_programs` commands.\n  The processing order of these install rules relative to\n  those generated by :command:`install_targets`,\n  :command:`install_files`, and :command:`install_programs` commands\n  is not defined.\n", 
    "macro": "macro\n-----\n\nStart recording a macro for later invocation as a command.\n\n::\n\n  macro(<name> [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])\n    COMMAND1(ARGS ...)\n    COMMAND2(ARGS ...)\n    ...\n  endmacro(<name>)\n\nDefine a macro named <name> that takes arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3\n(...).  Commands listed after macro, but before the matching endmacro,\nare not invoked until the macro is invoked.  When it is invoked, the\ncommands recorded in the macro are first modified by replacing formal\nparameters (``${arg1}``) with the arguments passed, and then invoked as\nnormal commands.  In addition to referencing the formal parameters you\ncan reference the values ``${ARGC}`` which will be set to the number of\narguments passed into the function as well as ``${ARGV0}`` ``${ARGV1}``\n``${ARGV2}`` ...  which will have the actual values of the arguments\npassed in.  This facilitates creating macros with optional arguments.\nAdditionally ``${ARGV}`` holds the list of all arguments given to the\nmacro and ``${ARGN}`` holds the list of arguments past the last expected\nargument.\n\nSee the cmake_policy() command documentation for the behavior of\npolicies inside macros.\n\nMacro Argument Caveats\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nNote that the parameters to a macro and values such as ``ARGN`` are\nnot variables in the usual CMake sense.  They are string\nreplacements much like the C preprocessor would do with a macro.\nTherefore you will NOT be able to use commands like::\n\n if(ARGV1) # ARGV1 is not a variable\n foreach(loop_var IN LISTS ARGN) # ARGN is not a variable\n\nIn the first case you can use ``if(${ARGV1})``, in the second case, you can\nuse ``foreach(loop_var ${ARGN})`` but this will skip empty arguments.\nIf you need to include them, you can use::\n\n set(list_var \"${ARGN}\")\n foreach(loop_var IN LISTS list_var)\n\nNote that if you have a variable with the same name in the scope from\nwhich the macro is called, using unreferenced names will use the\nexisting variable instead of the arguments. For example::\n\n macro(_BAR)\n   foreach(arg IN LISTS ARGN)\n     [...]\n   endforeach()\n endmacro()\n\n function(_FOO)\n   _bar(x y z)\n endfunction()\n\n _foo(a b c)\n\nWill loop over ``a;b;c`` and not over ``x;y;z`` as one might be expecting.\nIf you want true CMake variables and/or better CMake scope control you\nshould look at the function command.\n",

Typical usage\n\n::\n\n  file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)\n\nstores a list in the variable \"myfile\" in which each item is a line\nfrom the input file.\n\nGLOB will generate a list of all files that match the globbing\nexpressions and store it into the variable.  Globbing expressions are\nsimilar to regular expressions, but much simpler.  If RELATIVE flag is\nspecified for an expression, the results will be returned as a\nrelative path to the given path.  (We do not recommend using GLOB to\ncollect a list of source files from your source tree.  If no\nCMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is added or removed then the\ngenerated build system cannot know when to ask CMake to regenerate.)\n\nExamples of globbing expressions include:\n\n::\n\n   *.cxx      - match all files with extension cxx\n   *.vt?      - match all files with extension vta,...,vtz\n   f[3-5].txt - match files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt\n\nGLOB_RECURSE will generate a list similar to the regular GLOB, except\nit will traverse all the subdirectories of the matched directory and\nmatch the files.  Subdirectories that are symlinks are only traversed\nif FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given or cmake policy CMP0009 is not set to NEW.\nSee cmake --help-policy CMP0009 for more information.\n\nExamples of recursive globbing include:\n\n::\n\n   /dir/*.py  - match all python files in /dir and subdirectories\n\nMAKE_DIRECTORY will create the given directories, also if their parent\ndirectories don't exist yet\n\nRENAME moves a file or directory within a filesystem, replacing the\ndestination atomically.\n\nREMOVE will remove the given files, also in subdirectories\n\nREMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and directories, also\nnon-empty directories\n\nRELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from directory to the given\nfile.\n\nTO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path with unix /.\nThe input can be a single path or a system path like \"$ENV{PATH}\".\nNote the double quotes around the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes\none argument.  This command will also convert the native list\ndelimiters for a list of paths like the PATH environment variable.\n\nTO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will convert from a\ncmake style path into the native path style \\ for windows and / for\nUNIX.\n\nDOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file.  If LOG var is\nspecified a log of the download will be put in var.  If STATUS var is\nspecified the status of the operation will be put in var.  The status\nis returned in a list of length 2.  The first element is the numeric\nreturn value for the operation, and the second element is a string\nvalue for the error.  A 0 numeric error means no error in the\noperation.  If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout\nafter time seconds, time should be specified as an integer.  The\nINACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds of\ninactivity after which the operation should terminate.  If\nEXPECTED_HASH ALGO=value is specified, the operation will verify that\nthe downloaded file's actual hash matches the expected value, where\nALGO is one of MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512.  If it\ndoes not match, the operation fails with an error.  (\"EXPECTED_MD5\nsum\" is short-hand for \"EXPECTED_HASH MD5=sum\".) If SHOW_PROGRESS is\nspecified, progress information will be printed as status messages\nuntil the operation is complete.  For https URLs CMake must be built\nwith OpenSSL.  TLS/SSL certificates are not checked by default.  Set\nTLS_VERIFY to ON to check certificates and/or use EXPECTED_HASH to\nverify downloaded content.  Set TLS_CAINFO to specify a custom\nCertificate Authority file.  If either TLS option is not given CMake\nwill check variables CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY and CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO,\nrespectively.\n\nUPLOAD will upload the given file to the given URL.  If LOG var is\nspecified a log of the upload will be put in var.  If STATUS var is\nspecified the status of the operation will be put in var.  The status\nis returned in a list of length 2.  The first element is the numeric\nreturn value for the operation, and the second element is a string\nvalue for the error.  A 0 numeric error means no error in the\noperation.  If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout\nafter time seconds, time should be specified as an integer.  The\nINACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds of\ninactivity after which the operation should terminate.  If\nSHOW_PROGRESS is specified, progress information will be printed as\nstatus messages until the operation is complete.\n\nTIMESTAMP will write a string representation of the modification time\nof filename to variable.\n\nShould the command be unable to obtain a timestamp variable will be\nset to the empty string \"\".\n\nSee documentation of the string TIMESTAMP sub-command for more\ndetails.\n\nThe file() command also provides COPY and INSTALL signatures:\n\n::\n\n  file(<COPY|INSTALL> files... DESTINATION <dir>\n       [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]\n       [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]\n       [NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS]\n       [FILES_MATCHING]\n       [[PATTERN <pattern> | REGEX <regex>]\n        [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])\n\nThe COPY signature copies files, directories, and symlinks to a\ndestination folder.  Relative input paths are evaluated with respect\nto the current source directory, and a relative destination is\nevaluated with respect to the current build directory.  Copying\npreserves input file timestamps, and optimizes out a file if it exists\nat the destination with the same timestamp.  Copying preserves input\npermissions unless explicit permissions or NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS are\ngiven (default is USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS).  See the install(DIRECTORY)\ncommand for documentation of permissions, PATTERN, REGEX, and EXCLUDE\noptions.\n\nThe INSTALL signature differs slightly from COPY: it prints status\nmessages, and NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is default.  Installation scripts\ngenerated by the install() command use this signature (with some\nundocumented options for internal use).\n\nGENERATE will write an <output_file> with content from an\n<input_file>, or from <input_content>.  The output is generated\nconditionally based on the content of the <condition>.  The file is\nwritten at CMake generate-time and the input may contain generator\nexpressions.  The <condition>, <output_file> and <input_file> may also\ncontain generator expressions.  The <condition> must evaluate to\neither '0' or '1'.  The <output_file> must evaluate to a unique name\namong all configurations and among all invocations of file(GENERATE).\n",

You\nmay have multiple elseif clauses.  Note that the expression in the\nelse and endif clause is optional.  Long expressions can be used and\nthere is a traditional order of precedence.  Parenthetical expressions\nare evaluated first followed by unary tests such as ``EXISTS``,\n``COMMAND``, and ``DEFINED``.  Then any binary tests such as\n``EQUAL``, ``LESS``, ``GREATER``, ``STRLESS``, ``STRGREATER``,\n``STREQUAL``, and ``MATCHES`` will be evaluated.  Then boolean ``NOT``\noperators and finally boolean ``AND`` and then ``OR`` operators will\nbe evaluated.\n\nPossible expressions are:\n\n``if(<constant>)``\n True if the constant is ``1``, ``ON``, ``YES``, ``TRUE``, ``Y``,\n or a non-zero number.  False if the constant is ``0``, ``OFF``,\n ``NO``, ``FALSE``, ``N``, ``IGNORE``, ``NOTFOUND``, the empty string,\n or ends in the suffix ``-NOTFOUND``.  Named boolean constants are\n case-insensitive.  If the argument is not one of these constants, it\n is treated as a variable.\n\n``if(<variable>)``\n True if the variable is defined to a value that is not a false\n constant.  False otherwise.

Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.  If the file\n time stamps are exactly the same, an ``IS_NEWER_THAN`` comparison returns\n true, so that any dependent build operations will occur in the event\n of a tie.  This includes the case of passing the same file name for\n both file1 and file2.\n\n``if(IS_DIRECTORY path-to-directory)``\n True if the given name is a directory.

Therefore code like::\n\n set(var1 OFF)\n set(var2 \"var1\")\n if(${var2})\n\nappears to the if command as::\n\n if(var1)\n\nand is evaluated according to the ``if(<variable>)`` case documented\nabove.  The result is ``OFF`` which is false.  However, if we remove the\n``${}`` from the example then the command sees::\n\n if(var2)\n\nwhich is true because ``var2`` is defined to \"var1\" which is not a false\nconstant.\n\nAutomatic evaluation applies in the other cases whenever the\nabove-documented signature accepts ``<variable|string>``:\n\n* The left hand argument to ``MATCHES`` is first checked to see if it is\n  a defined variable, if so the variable's value is used, otherwise the\n  original value is used.\n\n* If the left hand argument to ``MATCHES`` is missing it returns false\n  without error\n\n* Both left and right hand arguments to ``LESS``, ``GREATER``, and\n  ``EQUAL`` are independently tested to see if they are defined\n  variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the original\n  value is used.\n\n* Both left and right hand arguments to ``STRLESS``, ``STREQUAL``, and\n  ``STRGREATER`` are independently tested to see if they are defined\n  variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the original\n  value is used.\n\n* Both left and right hand arguments to ``VERSION_LESS``,\n  ``VERSION_EQUAL``, and ``VERSION_GREATER`` are independently tested\n  to see if they are defined variables, if so their defined values are\n  used otherwise the original value is used.\n\n* The right hand argument to ``NOT`` is tested to see if it is a boolean\n  constant, if so the value is used, otherwise it is assumed to be a\n  variable and it is dereferenced.\n\n* The left and right hand arguments to ``AND`` and ``OR`` are independently\n  tested to see if they are boolean constants, if so they are used as\n  such, otherwise they are assumed to be variables and are dereferenced.\n",

Example of intended usage:\n\n::\n\n  add_executable(mytool mytool.c)\n  add_custom_command(\n    OUTPUT out.txt\n    COMMAND ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool\n            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt\n    DEPENDS mytool in.txt\n    )\n  add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)\n\nNote that CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR is no longer necessary for this purpose but\nhas been left for compatibility with existing projects.  Instead\nadd_custom_command() recognizes executable target names in its COMMAND\noption, so \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool\"\ncan be replaced by just \"mytool\".\n\nThis variable is read-only.

Release versions\n  used an even-valued second component, i.e.\n  ``<major>.<even-minor>.<patch>[-rc<n>]``.  Development versions\n  used an odd-valued second component with the development date as\n  the third component, i.e. ``<major>.<odd-minor>.<date>``.\n\n  The ``CMAKE_VERSION`` variable is defined by CMake 2.6.3 and higher.\n  Earlier versions defined only the individual component variables.\n",

It is commonly used by makefile\nusers in order to install software at non-default location.  It is a\nbasic relocation mechanism that should not be used on Windows (see\nCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX documentation).  It is usually invoked like this:\n\n::\n\n make DESTDIR=/home/john install\n\nwhich will install the concerned software using the installation\nprefix, e.g.  \"/usr/local\" prepended with the DESTDIR value which\nfinally gives \"/home/john/usr/local\".  When preparing a package, CPack\nfirst installs the items to be packaged in a local (to the build tree)\ndirectory by using the same DESTDIR mechanism.  Nevertheless, if\nCPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set then CPack will set DESTDIR before doing the\nlocal install.  The most noticeable difference is that without\nCPACK_SET_DESTDIR, CPack uses CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX as a\nprefix whereas with CPACK_SET_DESTDIR set, CPack will use\nCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX as a prefix.\n\nManually setting CPACK_SET_DESTDIR may help (or simply be necessary)\nif some install rules uses absolute DESTINATION (see CMake INSTALL\ncommand).  However, starting with CPack/CMake 2.8.3 RPM and DEB\ninstallers tries to handle DESTDIR automatically so that it is seldom\nnecessary for the user to set it.\n",
